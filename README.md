# VCSEL Array Driver

The goal of this project was to simulate the behavior and characteristics of a vcsel to ultimately determine the suitable parameters for an array of vcsels coherently coupled in an in-phase mode where the resulting laser's power is enhanced.

This work was done in collaboration of three students, namely Sujay, Karthik, and myself, supervised by Pawel Strzebonski in the Photonic Devices Research Group (PDRG) at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign.
